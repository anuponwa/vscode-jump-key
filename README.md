# jump-key README

This extension is *HEAVILY* based on `jump` extension from Wenfang Du. I adjusted functionality a bit to suit my coding style more.

## Features

- Jump to the start of character groups with character-codes inserted in those jumpable places. `Alt+,`
- Jump to the end of character groups with character-codes inserted in those jumpable places. `Alt+.`
- Select to the start of character groups with character-codes inserted in those jumpable places. `Alt+shift+,`
- Select to the end of character groups with character-codes inserted in those jumpable places. `Alt+shift+.`

The character-codes inserted use color and background color that are nice to the eyes, and match my favorite color theme: Catppuccin Frappe.

## Known Issues

The only issue I might improve in the future is the key tracking while in jump mode.

Now if you mess up or want to change keys you pressed, it doesn't work.

## Release Notes
